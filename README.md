# The Huffman-Coding Collection

## Motivation

I embarked on this project with a passion for exploring various programming languages and delving into fundamental computer science concepts. The implementation of Huffman coding presented a perfect opportunity to immerse myself in a multifaceted coding adventure, covering a broad range of topics in programming languages.

#### Comprehensive Learning Experience

1. Data Structures: The project necessitated the understanding of data structures, especially priority queues and trees, to encode and decode information.
2. File I/O: Working on file input/output operations sharpened my skills in handling external data, a crucial aspect of real-world applications.
3. Types, Loops, and Conditions: Crafting the Huffman coding algorithm involved a meticulous use of data types, loops, and conditions. This provided a hands-on experience in applying these foundational programming constructs.

#### Actual Utility

Beyond the educational aspect, Huffman coding is a practically useful endeavor. It serves as a powerful tool for data compression, finding applications in various domains where efficient storage and transmission of data are essential.

## Languages

I implemented the Huffman coding algorithm in multiple programming languages, including:

- Go
- Python
- C++
- C#
- Java

Each implementation showcases the adaptability of the algorithm across different languages and provides a holistic view of programming language nuances.

## How to Use

Follow the instructions in each language-specific directory to run and test the Huffman coding implementation. Feel free to explore, modify, and adapt the code for your own projects.

## Todos

- [ ] Write binary code in char table as bytes not as utf-8 strings

## Contributing

I welcome contributions to enhance the functionality and maintainability of this Huffman coding implementation. If you're interested, feel free to open issues, submit pull requests, or contribute to the project in any meaningful way.
